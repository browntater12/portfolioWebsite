With little time to adjust, I was thrown onto the R&D product engineering team, responsible for bringing new and innovative solutions into the business. At first, I loved it. I was hungry to prove myself, and my new boss, well aware of my drive, assigned me to the team’s biggest problems—all of which involved third-party software systems that weren’t functioning as expected.<br>&emsp;I jumped in headfirst, eager for the challenge. I quickly became the company’s subject matter expert on these platforms and ended up rewriting the low-code configurations that had been implemented during setup. After proving that my changes could drastically improve throughput, I approached upper management. No one would approve the changes, fearing they might disrupt global operations.<br>&emsp;After a month of waiting, I told the team, 'If this fails, it’s fully on me, but I’m taking the leap.' The result? We cut processing time per device worldwide by about 50%. That was my first real lesson in corporate politics.<br>&emsp;Being so immersed in software during my first two years at Asurion, I started taking night classes in software development. Eventually, I transitioned into a software engineering role, working on our ERP system.

I set my LinkedIn to Open to Work and started applying for Sales Engineering positions. To my surprise, no one in high-paying sales roles wanted an engineer with zero experience who had just taken a gap year. This would be my third time essentially starting from scratch—but that only made me more excited to figure it out.<br><br>&emsp;Fastenal reached out to me on LinkedIn after I applied. The job description was vague when it came to compensation, but overall, I’d be leading presentations, identifying cost savings, and selling solutions. I didn’t mind taking a 40% pay cut from my last corporate job—I wasn’t happy anyway. I joined the role excited to prove myself and sell a ton of bolts.<br><br>&emsp;To my surprise, I was more of a technical advisor than a true salesperson—essentially telling customers, 'Hey, this bolt is wrong; you should be using this one instead.' I started calling it solution-based sales.<br><br>&emsp;After about eight months, they finally let me operate more independently—or so I thought. I soon learned that my commission was heavily capped and that I’d have to fight for every dollar I earned. After a year, I had made $10K less than they had originally promised, despite leading North America in tasks.
